## Test environments
* Local Arch Linux Install Devel, and Release
* Ubuntu 16.04 (travis-ci), Relase
* Win Builder, Devel and Release

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There were two NOTEs:
* This is a first-submission
* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: Cragg (10:25), Yogo (10:52).
	These are both names.

Thanks for your help!
